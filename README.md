# Image-Retrieval

### Hi guys! 

# This project:
1. Uses Unsplash.com to retrieve images from API.
2. Has a basic image search functionality. 
3. Display results in GRID layout. 
4. Remembers previosu search queries in local storage ( no duplicates ) 
5. Suggests lasts 5 search queries in the search input as an autocomplete dropdown. 

I have also tried to implement this project by using query list instead of local storage, so you can see an example here: # https://staniulis.eu/image-retrieval/
